# Common Source Amplifier
There are two MOSFETs. One acts as the amplifying stage and we will call this M1, and the other is the active load which we will call M2. Depending on the type of active load, the port of the active load corresponding to the direction of current is connected to the drain of M1. The source of M1 is connected to a lower voltage level than the supply.
