# Static CMOS Inverter
An Inverter is an electronic circuit which inverts the input. For example, if given a high input voltage it will produce a low output voltage. If given a low input voltage it will produce a high output voltage.
The pmos is typically placed above the nmos.
The pmos is above the nmos and it's source is tied to vdd. The nmos source is tied to ground. The nmos drain and pmos drain are routed together. The node connecting the nmos and pmos drain is the output node. Additonally, the nmos gate and pmos gate are connected. The node connecting the nmos and pmos gate is the input node. 
The sizing ratio is the ratio between pmos width and nmos width. The sizing ratio is typically the most optimal when it is 2:1.
